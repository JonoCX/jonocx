Hey there! :wave:

Iâ€™m a Research Associate at the University of Manchester with a passion for making technology personalised and engaging.

Before joining back up with academia, I was a Lead MLOps Engineer at Fuzzy Labs, where I helped various clients implement practical machine learning solutions, both generative and traditional.

Prior to that, I earned a PhD from the University of Manchester with the BBC where my work broke new ground in understanding user engagement with personalised media, developing models to predict when users connect with â€“ or abandon â€“ content.

Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by the sweet spot where ML meets Human-Computer Interaction, especially user behaviour modelling and Recommendation Systems. I also enjoy tinkering with the latest tech (so do check out my [blog!](https://jonocx.github.io/blog/), and when Iâ€™m not doing that, you can usually find me running around the Peak and Lake District! :mountain: :runner:
